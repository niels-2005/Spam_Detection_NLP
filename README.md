# Spam_Detection_NLP

Welcome to the **Spam_Detection_NLP** repository! This project focuses on the implementation of a machine learning model for detecting spam emails using natural language processing techniques. It utilizes a dataset of email contents to train models that can differentiate between 'Ham' (non-spam) and 'Spam' emails.

## Project Overview

**Spam_Detection_NLP** uses a dataset comprising thousands of email texts, each labeled as 'Ham' or 'Spam'. The primary objective is to apply preprocessing methods to the text data, transform it into a suitable format for machine learning, and train classifiers to accurately predict the nature of the emails.

### Data Preparation

The dataset initially contains 193,852 emails, which are then deduplicated and cleaned to remove NaN values, resulting in 193,850 entries. Each email's text is preprocessed to remove emojis, special characters, and extra spaces to ensure high-quality input for model training.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Analysis includes:
- Visualizing the balance of labels to understand the dataset's composition.
- Transforming the 'label' column into numeric format for processing.
- Generating and visualizing word counts to assess the text length distribution.

### Model Training and Evaluation

Several pipelines are compared using different combinations of vectorizers and classifiers, including:
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forests
- Gradient Boosting Machines
- Others using techniques like TF-IDF transformation

The best performing models are identified based on accuracy and are further evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Objectives

- **Spam Detection Accuracy**: Enhance the capability to detect spam emails accurately.
- **Model Optimization**: Optimize NLP models to handle unbalanced data and various text complexities.
- **Scalability and Performance**: Ensure the model can handle large volumes of data efficiently.

## Conclusion

The project aims to provide a robust solution for spam detection that can be integrated into email systems to filter out unwanted messages, enhancing user experience and security.
